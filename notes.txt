As it turns out, the Redux store only takes one reducer. 
In fact, a reducer is the first and only argument that createStore 
requires to create a store. A lot of folks seem to miss this at
first because they see that we usually end up writing many reducers 
to handle various parts of our state. But we can only pass Redux a
single reducer when calling createStore() to set up our store.
The reducer we pass to the store is often called the "root reducer."
